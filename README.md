🚗 Car Sales EDA Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes global car sales performance across multiple brands, years, and regions. This project focuses on uncovering key business insights by exploring sales trends, brand performance, and revenue metrics using advanced visual analytics.
🔍 Problem Statement

Automobile companies often operate across multiple regions with hundreds of branches and models, making it difficult to:

    Identify top-performing brands and models.

    Understand sales trends across time (months, quarters, years).

    Compare regional or country-level performance.

    Monitor KPIs like units sold, revenue per branch, and per-unit revenue.

This project aims to simplify and visualize car sales data for decision-makers to improve business strategy, resource allocation, and market targeting.
📈 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The dashboard highlights the following KPIs:

    Total Revenue – Total monetary value of all car sales (e.g., $19.33bn).

    Units Sold – Total number of units sold globally (e.g., 4M units).

    Revenue per Unit – Average revenue generated per unit sold.

    Revenue per Branch – Average revenue generated per branch worldwide.

    Total Countries – Number of countries where sales occurred (e.g., 245).

    Total Branches – Total number of dealership branches (e.g., 1856).
