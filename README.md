# *🚗 Car Sales EDA Dashboard*

This project focuses on uncovering key business insights by exploring sales trends, brand performance, and revenue metrics using advanced visual analytics. It includes an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyses global car sales performance across multiple brands, years, and regions.
## 🔍 Problem Statement

Automobile companies often operate across multiple regions with hundreds of branches and models, making it difficult to:

1. Identify top-performing brands and models.

2. Understand sales trends across time (months, quarters, years).

3. Compare regional or country-level performance.

4. Monitor KPIs like units sold, revenue per branch, and per-unit revenue.

This project simplifies and visualises car sales data for decision-makers to improve business strategy, resource allocation, and market targeting.

## 📈 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The dashboard highlights the following KPIs:

1. Total Revenue – Total monetary value of all car sales (e.g., $19.33bn).

2. Units Sold – Total number of units sold globally (e.g., 4M units).

3. Revenue per Unit – Average revenue generated per unit sold.

4. Revenue per Branch – Average revenue generated per branch worldwide.

5. Total Countries – Number of countries where sales occurred (e.g., 245).

6. Total Branches – Total number of dealership branches (e.g., 1856).

## 📊 Dashboard Features

1. Treemap of Top Brands by Revenue – Identifies leading brands like Toyota, Nissan, and Ford.

2. Revenue by Quarter – Breaks down annual performance into Q1–Q4 to spot seasonal trends.

3. Monthly Revenue Trends – Visualises both revenue and units sold per month.

4. Yearly Revenue Trends – Tracks performance over time from 2017 to 2020.

5. Interactive Filters – Brand, Year, and Country slicers to customise views dynamically.

## ✅ Outcomes & Insights

1. Toyota and Nissan are top contributors to total revenue.

2. Sales peaked in Q3 and Q4, showing strong seasonal demand.

3. There's a significant drop in revenue in 2020, possibly due to global disruptions (e.g., pandemic).

4. Disparities in revenue per branch can highlight underperforming areas for further investigation.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

1. Power BI – Data modelling, DAX calculations, visual storytelling.

2. DAX – For KPIs, TopN calculations, and time-based aggregation.

3. Excel/CSV – As the primary data source (assumed based on structure).
